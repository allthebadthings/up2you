After logging in, you'll see a setup wizard:

1. **Enter your website details:**
   - Property Name: `UP2YOU Jewelry`
   - Website URL: `https://yourdomain.com` (or just skip this)
   - Click **"Add Property"**

2. **Customize your widget (optional):**
   - You can pick colors (we'll override this anyway)
   - Just click through - we'll style it to match

3. **You'll land on the dashboard** ✅

---

## Step 3: Get Your Widget Code (2 minutes)

This is the important part - you need to copy some numbers!

1. **In the Tawk.to dashboard**, look at the left sidebar
2. Click **"Administration"** (gear icon at bottom)
3. Click **"Channels"**
4. Click **"Chat Widget"**
5. You'll see your widget code that looks like this:

```html
<!--Start of Tawk.to Script-->
<script type="text/javascript">
var Tawk_API=Tawk_API||{}, Tawk_LoadStart=new Date();
(function(){
var s1=document.createElement("script"),s0=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
s1.async=true;
s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/XXXXXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYYY';
s1.charset='UTF-8';
s1.setAttribute('crossorigin','*');
s0.parentNode.insertBefore(s1,s0);
})();
</script>
<!--End of Tawk.to Script-->
```

6. **Look for the two important codes in that URL:**
   - `XXXXXXXXXXXXX` ← This is your **Property ID**
   - `YYYYYYYYYYY` ← This is your **Widget ID**

   They'll look something like:
   - Property ID: `5f8a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k`
   - Widget ID: `default` or `1a2b3c4d`

7. **Copy both of these!** You'll need them in the next step.

## Step 4: Add It to Your Website (30 seconds)

Now the easy part:

1. **Log in to your UP2YOU admin panel:**
   👉 Go to: `https://yourwebsite.com/admin`

2. **Click "Settings" in the left menu**

3. **Scroll down to "Live Chat Settings"**

4. **Paste your codes:**
   - Property ID: `XXXXXXXXXXXXX`
   - Widget ID: `YYYYYYYYYYY`

5. **Click "Save Settings"**

2. Click "Profile"
3. Change display name to "Kim - UP2YOU Jewelry"
4. Add a profile picture if you want

### Set Your Availability:
1. In the app or dashboard, you can set yourself as:
   - **Online** (green dot) - you're available to chat now
   - **Away** (yellow dot) - you might respond later
   - **Offline** (gray dot) - customers can leave messages

### Auto-Responses:
1. In dashboard → "Administration" → "Shortcuts"
2. Create canned responses for common questions:
   - Shipping info
   - Return policy

### "I don't see the chat on my website"
- Did you click "Save Settings" in the admin panel?
- Refresh your website (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### "I'm not getting notifications"
- Check your phone's notification settings
- Make sure you're logged into the app
- In Tawk.to dashboard → Settings → Notifications (enable email/push)

### "The chat button looks different than expected"

- It'll be the crimson/gold colors automatically
